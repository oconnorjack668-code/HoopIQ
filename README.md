# Deadeye

A mobile-first basketball player development app: log basketball sessions and
gym work, track goals and streaks, study the game, get AI coaching grounded in
your own logged data, and analyse shooting video on-device.

Next.js 16 (App Router) · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS · Supabase · PWA

## Running it locally

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # then fill in at least the Supabase keys + OWNER_EMAIL
npm run dev
```

You need a Supabase project. Create one, then apply everything in
`supabase/migrations/` in filename order (30 migrations) via the Supabase SQL
editor or the Supabase CLI, then `supabase/seed.sql`. Every migration is safe
to re-run: policies are dropped before they are created, tables and indexes use
`IF NOT EXISTS`, and content inserts skip rows that already exist.

One exception worth reading before you run it: `00025` deletes duplicate
post-session AI reports (keeping the oldest for each session) because the
unique index it adds cannot be created while duplicates exist. The file carries
a `SELECT` that previews exactly what it would remove.

Set `OWNER_EMAIL` to the account that should hold the `owner` role — it grants
unlimited AI credits, Pro features and the admin screens, and is enforced
server-side in `src/lib/auth.ts` (never from a client flag).

`.env.example` documents every variable the code actually reads, and which
features stay dormant without them. AI and Stripe features are optional: with
no key configured they show an honest "not configured" state rather than
fabricating output or silently failing.

## Quality gates

```bash
npm run lint        # eslint
npx tsc --noEmit    # types
npm test            # vitest (35 files, 247 tests)
npm run build       # production build
```

All four are expected to pass, with exactly one accepted lint warning: a
`react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` on `loadQuiz` in `study/[id]/quiz/page.tsx`. Leave
it — the obvious fix (adding `loadQuiz` to the dependency array) ships an
infinite fetch loop, because the function is recreated on every render.

Run the gates **sequentially**. Running `npm test` alongside `lint`/`tsc`
starves the test process and `stripe-webhook.test.ts` fails on vitest's 5s
default timeout; the test is not flaky on its own.

`tsc --noEmit` in particular should stay at zero errors — the Supabase schema
types in `src/lib/supabase/types.ts` are hand-maintained (there is no
`supabase gen types` step), and a schema that doesn't satisfy the client's
`GenericSchema` constraint silently degrades every query to `never` without any
lint error. If you add a table or column in a migration, add it there too,
including its `Relationships: []` entry — and if you add an enum-like `CHECK`
constraint, widen the matching TypeScript union, which has drifted before.

## Layout

```
src/app/(auth)/       login, signup, verify, reset
src/app/(app)/        the app: dashboard, basketball, workouts (incl. fuel),
                      goals, ai-coach, study, drills, programs, guides, video,
                      leaderboard, achievements, friends, teams, games,
                      style-match, settings, profile, pro, admin
src/app/api/          route handlers (AI, Stripe webhook, push, crons, share)
src/lib/              auth, supabase clients + schema types, AI providers,
                      offline queue, scoring/stats helpers, video analysis
src/components/       UI primitives and feature components
supabase/migrations/  schema, RLS policies and seed content
__tests__/            unit tests
```

Auth session refresh runs in `src/proxy.ts` (Next.js 16 renamed `middleware` to
`proxy`). Every player-owned table has RLS restricting rows to their owner, and
video is kept in a private bucket.

Owner-only tools live at `/admin`, reachable from the shield badge in the
header. They include a detector benchmark for measuring shot detection against
a real clip.

## Two deliberate design decisions

**Fuel tracking is habits, not calories.** `fuel_logs` records whether you ate
before and after training, water, sleep and energy — there is no intake total in
the schema and no composite score in the UI. Players start at 13, a numeric
intake target aimed at teenagers is a documented route into disordered eating,
and it would contradict the safety rules the AI coach already enforces. Don't
add macros without an explicit decision to, and age-gate them if you do.

**The IQ section is designed not to be finishable.** A question of the day walks
a per-player shuffle of the whole pool, so every question is seen once before
any repeats — 300 questions is 300 days. Adding content extends that directly;
it is not the only lever.

## On-device video

Shot tracking and form check run entirely in the browser via MediaPipe Tasks
Vision — frames never leave the phone. Shot detection uses a general-purpose
COCO object detector plus rim-crossing geometry, with the player confirming or
correcting every call before it is saved.

Detection runs on a **crop around the rim**, not the whole frame. The model
takes a 320px square input, so a 2561px-wide clip was downscaled about 8× and a
basketball landed on roughly a dozen pixels. Measured on real footage: the model
scored `person` at 0.919 but `sports ball` at only 0.174 full-frame, rising to
0.729 on the crop. The rim is measured from two taps — one on each side — rather
than assumed, which is what makes the crop possible and what lets the tracker
work on side-on footage or with the hoop near a frame edge.

Overall counting accuracy still has not been measured against labelled footage.
Treat the counts as assistive rather than authoritative, and keep the review
step before saving. `/admin/detector-bench` measures a clip and compares
full-frame against the crop.

## Lesson videos

`study_items.youtube_video_id` holds a real YouTube id, and the lesson page
embeds it via `youtube-nocookie`. A lesson still holding `'placeholder'` falls
back to a YouTube search and says so.

If you curate more, verify the id before committing it: YouTube's oEmbed
endpoint returns the title and channel for a real video and HTTP 400 for an
invented one. Use the `author_name` it returns as the channel, rather than
typing one in.

## Historical docs

`IMPLEMENTATION.md`, `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md` and `DEPLOYMENT_TESTING.md` date
from the first day of the build and describe a much smaller version of the app
(19 pages, 6 migrations). Useful for shape, unreliable on specifics — this
README and `.env.example` are the current source of truth.
