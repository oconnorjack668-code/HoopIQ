// Onboarding asks for goals, strengths and focus areas, and until now those
// answers only ever reached the AI coach's prompt - so a player without an AI
// key configured answered three screens of questions and saw nothing come of
// it. The programs table already has a `goal` column and /programs already
// filters on it; this is the missing link between the two.
