// Every other number on the dashboard only moves when you train, so there is
// nothing to come back for on a rest day. This gives one honest line that is
// still meaningful when you have not trained - and, unlike a wearable
// "recovery score", it claims nothing physiological. It counts days you logged
// training, because that is all the app actually knows.
