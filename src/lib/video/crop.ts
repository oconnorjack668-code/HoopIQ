//
// Measured on a 2561x1184 clip: efficientdet_lite0 takes a 320x320 input, so
// the whole frame is downscaled about 8x and a basketball lands on roughly a
// dozen pixels. The model scored `person` at 0.919 on that footage and
// `sports ball` at 0.174 on 16% of frames - it was not blind, the ball was
// simply too small to resolve. Cropping to the hoop removes the downscale.
//
// This is also the semantically right thing to do: the shot detector only arms
// when the ball is above rim level and within a few rim widths of it, so the
// ball's position at half court was never used.
